There is much more to black holes than meets the eye. In fact,
your eyes, even with the aid of the most advanced telescope, will
never see a black hole in space. The reason is that the matter
within a black hole is so dense and has so great a gravitational pull
that it prevents even light from escaping.
 
Like other electromagnetic radiation (radio waves, infrared
rays, ultraviolet radiation, X-rays, and gamma radiation), light is
the fastest traveler in the Universe. It moves at nearly 300,000
kilometers (about 186,000 miles) per second. At such a speed, you
could circle the Earth seven times between heartbeats.
 
If light can't escape a black hole, it follows that nothing else
can.Consequently, there is no direct way to detect a black hole.
 
In fact, the principal evidence of the existence of black holes
comes not from observation but from solutions to complex equations
based on Einstein's Theory of General Relativity. Among other
things, the calculations indicate that black holes may occur in a
variety of sizes and be more abundant than most of us realize.
